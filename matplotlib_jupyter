## Introduction to Matplotlib

**Description:** Having had little to no formal coding classes myself, I understand the struggle of learning a new programming language. Though, having successfully overcome that challenge, I understand the need for a powerful processor. In my experience, many resort back to other programs when they need to get things done quickly. In an attempt to correct this, I created this cheat sheet such that hopefully someone completely new at python might be able to quickly plot up data.

I've also provided my jupyter notebook in an attempt to make things easier.
